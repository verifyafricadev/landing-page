          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This Cookie Policy explains how VerifyAfrica Inc. ("VerifyAfrica," "we," "our," or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies on the website verifyafrica.io, in our web dashboards, API documentation portals, and any other online services that link to this notice (collectively, the "Site").
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            VerifyAfrica is a Delaware-incorporated company and a wholly owned subsidiary of CJ Solutions Ltd, a Cyprus-based compliance and AML advisory group. Because of this cross-border structure, we follow not only U.S. law but also the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Nigeria's Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). This means we handle cookies and online identifiers in a way that respects user choice, data minimization, and transparency no matter where you visit us from.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            By continuing to browse our Site after seeing a cookie banner or notification, you consent to the use of cookies described here. If you do not agree, you can manage or disable cookies at any time using your browser settings or our cookie preferences tool.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* What Cookies Are */}
        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Cookies Are</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Cookies are small text files that websites place on your device (computer, tablet, or phone) when you visit. They allow websites to recognize your device, remember your preferences, and improve your browsing experience. Some cookies are strictly necessary for a website to function, while others help analyze usage, personalize content, and deliver relevant communications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Similar technologies such as local storage, web beacons, pixels, and SDK event trackers may also be used for the same purposes. We refer to all of these collectively as "cookies" in this policy.
          </p>

        {/* Why We Use Cookies */}
        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why We Use Cookies</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            VerifyAfrica uses cookies to provide, secure, and improve our services. We group our cookie usage into several key purposes.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-3">1. Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            These cookies are required to make the Site work properly. They enable core functionality such as page navigation, form submissions, account login, session management, and security features. Without them, parts of the Site will not function correctly.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-3">2. Analytics and Performance Cookies</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We use analytics cookies to understand how visitors interact with verifyafrica.io — for example, which pages are visited most, where visitors come from, and how long they stay. This helps us improve performance, usability, and the relevance of our content. Where possible, we configure analytics to anonymize IP addresses and to respect "Do Not Track" signals.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-3">3. Preference and Functionality Cookies</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            These cookies remember choices you make, such as language settings, cookie-consent selections, and dashboard display preferences. They allow the Site to deliver a more personal and consistent experience each time you visit.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-3">4. Marketing and Communication Cookies</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            If we run limited campaigns or newsletters, these cookies help measure the effectiveness of our communications. They allow us to understand whether someone opened an email, visited a page, or expressed interest in a feature. We do not use invasive advertising networks or cross-site behavioral tracking.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Legal Basis for Using Cookies */}
        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Legal Basis for Using Cookies</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Under GDPR and NDPR, the legal basis for using strictly necessary cookies is VerifyAfrica's legitimate interest in providing a functional, secure, and efficient website. For all other categories — such as analytics, preference, and marketing cookies — we rely on your consent, which you can give through our cookie banner or preferences tool.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When you first visit verifyafrica.io, a cookie banner appears. By selecting "Accept All," you consent to our use of optional cookies. You can click "Manage Preferences" to choose specific categories or "Reject Non-Essential Cookies" to continue using the Site with only essential cookies active.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time via the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of our Site. Withdrawal of consent will not affect cookies already necessary for basic operation.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Cookies Placed by Third Parties */}
        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Cookies Placed by Third Parties</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Some cookies on our Site are placed by third-party providers we use to operate and analyze our platform. These may include cloud hosting services, analytics platforms, and customer support or live-chat tools. Each provider acts as a data processor on VerifyAfrica's behalf and is bound by a written agreement requiring compliance with GDPR and NDPR standards.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Where third-party cookies are set directly by an external platform (for example, embedded videos or social-media buttons), those providers may act as independent controllers. In such cases, their own privacy and cookie policies apply, and we encourage you to review them for more information.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Managing Cookies and Your Choices */}
        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Managing Cookies and Your Choices</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            You can manage or delete cookies at any time by adjusting your browser settings. Most browsers let you block or delete cookies, or alert you when a site tries to place them. The following links provide guidance for popular browsers:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2 ml-4">

          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you disable or delete cookies, some parts of the Site may not function as intended.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            EU and African visitors can also use our on-site cookie management panel to exercise granular control. If you withdraw consent, we immediately deactivate all non-essential cookies and remove any identifiers associated with you from those systems.
          </p>

        {/* How Long Cookies Last */}
        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Long Cookies Last</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Cookies can be "session" cookies, which expire when you close your browser, or "persistent" cookies, which remain for a set period unless you delete them. VerifyAfrica uses a combination of both. We retain persistent cookies only as long as necessary for their stated purpose. Analytics cookies typically expire within 13 months, while preference cookies may persist up to 24 months to honor your selections.
          </p>

        {/* Children and Cookies */}

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Children and Cookies</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            VerifyAfrica's Site and services are intended for business users and are not directed at children under the age of sixteen. We do not knowingly store cookies or collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has used our services without parental consent, please contact privacy@verifyafrica.io so we can take appropriate action.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Because VerifyAfrica operates from the United States under oversight of CJ Solutions Ltd in Cyprus, cookies and data collected through them may be transferred internationally. These transfers occur under recognized safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses and intercompany data-transfer agreements. All cookies and analytics data are stored on secure, access-controlled servers, with encryption and anonymization applied where appropriate.
