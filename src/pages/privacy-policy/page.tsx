						1. Introduction
					</h2>
					<p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						At VerifyAfrica, privacy is not merely a regulatory obligation — it
						is the cornerstone of our brand promise and a non‑negotiable part of
						our corporate DNA. The company recognizes that identity verification
						inherently involves the collection and processing of personal and
						sensitive data. Therefore, it has adopted a privacy‑first operating
						model that embeds protection mechanisms into every layer of its
						infrastructure and service delivery pipeline.
					</p>
					<p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
						This Privacy Policy outlines the guiding principles under which
						VerifyAfrica processes personal data, the lawful bases for doing so,
						the rights of data subjects, and the organizational and technical
						safeguards that ensure data integrity across all markets in which
						the company operates.
